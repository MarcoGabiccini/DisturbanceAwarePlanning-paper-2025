	abstract = {Optimal control calculations are used to study the effect of tyre wear on race car performance. This is achieved by solving a minimum lap time optimal control problem over multiple laps using a dynamical model of a Formula One car. A previously developed thermodynamic model is enhanced by adding an additional state for the carcass temperature of the tyres. The tyre grip is modelled as a function of the tyres’ wear and temperature. Grip reduces when tyres get worn, or the tyres are not operated within their optimal temperature window. Overheating the tyres can accelerate wear, which in turn, degrades performance. The optimal control problem solver needs to ‘manage’ the state of tyres throughout a race (not just a single lap) to ensure that optimal race performance is achieved. At some point during a race a pit stop may be required to change worn tyres so that tyre grip can be restored. It is essential to understand the wear characteristics of various tyre compounds in order to determine the point when the time needed for a pit stop is justified in terms of subsequent racing performance.}

	ABSTRACT = {Minimum lap-time planning (MLTP) is a well-established problem in the race car industry to provide guidelines for drivers and optimize the vehicle’s setup. In this paper, we tackle the 3D nature of the problem in its full extension, making no simplifying assumptions on the mechanics of the system. We propose a multibody vehicle model, described by rigorous dynamical equations. To effectively handle the resulting complexity, we devised an efficient direct dynamics computational method based on Featherstone’s articulated-body algorithm (ABA). To solve the MLTP, we employed a direct-collocation technique, discretizing the problem so that all information of the 3D track is pre-processed and directly embedded into the discrete problem. This discretization approach turns out to be perfectly compatible with our vehicle model, leading to a solution in accessible computational time frames. The high level of detail of the model makes the proposed approach most useful for in-depth vehicle dynamics analyses on complex tracks. To substantiate the analysis, we provide a comparison with the results obtained by a double-track model on the Nürburgring Nordschleife circuit. Consistently with the average trend defined by the double track, the proposed model features a more dynamically rich behavior, realistically capturing the higher-order effects elicited by the sharp corners and the highly variable slope of the track.},

The method uses an approximate stress analysis of each point in the tire as it rolls through the contact patch, and from this stress excursion the mechanical work done on each volume element can be converted into a heat release through a knowledge of material hysteresis characteristics. The tire cross-section is considered as an axisymmetric body with internal heat generation, and the heat diffusion equation is solved numerically with appropriate boundary conditions concerning wheel and runway surface. Comparison of data obtained from thermocouple embedded tires shows good agreement.}

	abstract = { Active systems are gaining significant importance because of their ability of enhancing handling performance, stability, and driver engagement, especially in sports cars. The upfront study of the achievable handling characteristics with a specific actuator set is crucial, given the involved development costs and time. In this context, although several recent studies have compared the cornering response associated with different chassis actuations, none of them has analysed in detail the resulting performance envelope, i.e. the feasibility region, based on the operating limit of the available hardware. This study targets the identified gap and presents a methodology for obtaining the feasibility region of chassis actuation systems, defined as the locus of the achievable understeer characteristics. The analysis considers front and rear active camber (FAC and RAC), rear-wheel-steering (RWS) and variable roll moment distribution (RMD). Simplified vehicle models with reduced number of degrees of freedom (DoFs) and other features to accurately obtain the feasibility region and the relevant dynamic response indicators in the early design stages of the vehicle are compared with a high-fidelity model based on VI-CarRealTime. The results highlight the favourable trade-off between complexity and accuracy of a 3-DoF nonlinear model accounting for suspension kinematics and compliances. }

This paper presents a method that utilizes this abundant actuating capability to allocate tire forces optimally with a convex optimization formulation. The basic objective of this optimal allocation is to keep the usage of total tire friction capability equal over the four wheels. Achieving this goal has the advantage of preventing some tires from reaching saturation before other tires do. This algorithm for optimal tire force allocation can be combined with trajectory tracking near the limits of handling to follow the desired speed, heading, and lateral position of a vehicle. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the method for successful tracking of all three desired trajectory states simultaneously while achieving equal friction usage among the tires.},

To objectively quantify the performance of given vehicle settings, minimum lap times can be determined using optimal control methods. The computed trajectories can be used to assess the benefits of certain actuators as well as to identify optimal vehicle setups and control strategies. This paper analyses the effect of rear-axle steering, longitudinal torque allocation via transfer case and selected vehicle parameters on lap time. The optimal roll moment distribution and longitudinal position of the centre of gravity are identified via concurrent optimisation. The optimal lap trajectories are generated by numerically solving a minimum-time optimal control problem using direct Hermite-Simpson collocation. To eliminate the problem of an unknown initial solution, the authors present an initialisation routine for vehicular optimal control problems.

Additionally, a concurrent optimisation is performed which provides the optimal gear ratios for the front and rear reduction gears as well as the optimal performance distribution between the front and rear motors under the specification of a fixed total motor performance. We characterise the motor performance by the maximum torque, the maximum speed and the overload capability of the electric machines. The essential dynamics are represented using a nonlinear two-track vehicle model and a Thevenin battery model.

A model-based feedforward controller is designed to improve handling but not to track an ideal response. A feedback controller based on close loop observation is used to ensure its cornering stability. The fusion of two controllers is used to stabilize a vehicle’s lateral motion. To increase lateral performance, an optimization-based control allocation distributes the wheel torques according to the remaining tire force potential. The simulation results show that a vehicle with the proposed controller exhibits more responsive lateral dynamic behavior and greater maximum lateral acceleration. The cornering safety is also demonstrated using a standard stability test.

	abstract = {This paper presents the design of a central feedforward control for the two chassis control systems rear-wheel steering (RWS) and torque vectoring (TV) which have related areas of intervention in lateral dynamics. A control strategy is presented in order to follow desired target values consisting of yaw acceleration and sideslip angle velocity. Central attention is given to the use of additional tyre information with the aim of enhancing vehicle handling and stability. With the knowledge of the mounted tyre type, an adaption law for the desired target values is derived. Although the focus is based on the usage of new tyre information, this modelling approach basically has the potential to reduce the need for coordination among the two systems RWS and TV, exploiting the synergies between both of them. Starting from an extended single-track model an exact Input–output linearisation method is used to design the feedforward control. This is followed by a proof of stability for the external and the internal dynamics of the controller. For the subsequent investigation, in a preliminary step, real-world in vehicle tests are carried out under varying tyre types with a wide spreading of characteristics. This serves as a basis to identify the most important tyre parameters for the controller and to derive the target goals. Finally, the controller is implemented in a 14-DOF non-linear entire vehicle model in Matlab/Simulink, that serves for simulations with a virtual vehicle plant. The performance of the presented feedforward control is assessed by specified objective criteria for steady-state and transient open-loop manoeuvres in lateral dynamics. These criteria are used to investigate the effectiveness of the control design with the aim to achieve the defined target motion. In addition to that, the manoeuvre results also serve to evaluate the control effort, involved in the coordinated cooperation of both systems.},

	abstract = {The increasing demands for driving comfort and driving dynamics lead to the introduction of a variety of control systems in modern vehicles. So far, these systems are working in peaceful coexistence and do not use potential synergies. This paper presents a modular control allocation, which combines lateral torque distribution at the rear axle, longitudinal torque distribution, and rear wheel steering. The previous investigations of torque vectoring mostly neglected the secondary yaw torque, which is a result of the dependency between lateral and longitudinal forces at the tyres. An increase in longitudinal forces leads to a decrease in lateral forces and, therefore, results in a yaw torque. A comprehensive vehicle and tyre model is used to analyze this secondary effect for different vehicle states and requested yaw torque. The investigation shows that the influence of the secondary yaw torque varies heavily depending on the vehicle state and the requested yaw torque. Especially, for stabilizing torque requests at high lateral acceleration, the secondary effect is significant and should not be neglected. The investigation shows that an optimal distribution for each yaw torque request exists and that results in maximum lateral forces and thereby maximum lateral acceleration. These results are used within the paper’s modular control allocation. A model-based reference generator delivers desirable yaw rates and side slip angles, which are transferred into necessary lateral forces at the wheels by the control allocation unit. This force-based approach enables modular expandability and usability across multiple vehicles. The proposed controller shows that using the available systems in conjunction helps to increase driving performance and the vehicles stability at the same time.},

Commonly, the student team performs a lap simulation as a point mass, bicycle or planar model of vehicle dynamics allow for the design of a top-level concept of the FSAE vehicle. However, to design diﬀerent FSAE components, a full vehicle simulation is required including a comprehensive tire model. In the proposed study, the diﬀerent tires of a FSAE vehicle were tested at a track to parametrize the tire based on the empirical approach commonly known as the magic formula. A thermal tire model was proposed to describe the tread, carcass, and inﬂation gas temperatures. The magic formula was modiﬁed to incorporate the temperature eﬀect on the force capability of a FSAE tire to achieve higher accuracy in the simulation environment. Considering the model validation, the several maneuvers, typical for FSAE competitions, were performed. A skidpad and full lap maneuvers were chosen to simulate steady-state and transient behavior of the FSAE vehicle. The full vehicle simulation results demonstrated a high correlation to the measurement data for steady-state maneuvers and limited accuracy in highly dynamic driving. In addition, the results show that neglecting temperature in the tire model results in higher root mean square error (RMSE) of lateral acceleration and yaw rate.},

The use of spatial vector notation greatly reduces the volume of algebra which allows systems to be described using fewer equations and fewer quantities. It also allows problems to be solved in fewer steps, and solutions to be expressed more succinctly. In addition algorithms are explained simply and clearly, and are expressed in a compact form. The use of spatial vector notation facilitates the implementation of dynamics algorithms on a computer: shorter, simpler code that is easier to write, understand and debug, with no loss of efficiency."

The kinematics of the suspension is exhaustively analysed and the impact of tyre longitudinal and lateral forces in determining vehicle trim is demonstrated. An indirect optimal control method is then used to solve the minimum lap time problem. Simulation outcomes are compared with experimental data acquired during a qualifying lap at Montmel´o circuit (Barcelona) in the 2012 GP2 season.

	This paper derives the dynamic equations of a reduced-order race-car model using Lie-group methods. While these methods are familiar to computational dynamicists and roboticists, their adoption in the vehicle dynamics community is limited. We address this gap by demonstrating how this framework integrates smoothly with the Articulated-Body Algorithm (ABA) and provides a fresh and systematic formulation of vehicle dynamics. For the first time, we model the car body as the end effector of a serial robot with a floating base connected to the track via virtual revolute and prismatic joints. Our formulation also accounts for the effects of 3D track geometry, providing a natural embedding of the car into the 3D track. We rigorously reconcile the ABA steps with key aspects of vehicle dynamics, including road-tire interactions, aerodynamic forces, and load transfers. The resulting model, simple yet accurate, is a powerful tool to efficiently solve Minimum-Lap-Time Planning problems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show numerical results obtained on the Nürburgring circuit. Our optimization problem is formulated via a direct collocation method and solved using the CasADi optimization suite. To validate the results, we test our reduced-order model against a full-fledged multi-body model recently developed by the same authors. The comparison confirms the validity of our reduced-order model, proving both the accuracy of the solution and the computational efficiency achieved.},
