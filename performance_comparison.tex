Checkpoints are indicated by labels and are uniformly spaced by $\Delta\al=0.01$. This sector includes two distinct corners: a low-speed turn from $\al = 0.72$ to $\al = 0.73$, and a high-speed turn from $\al = 0.75$ to $\al = 0.76$, allowing for the evaluation of vehicle behavior across different dynamic scenarios.}

\subsection{Robustified constraints comparison}
It is of interest to analyze how a robustified constraint---or a combination of the two described in Sections~\ref{sec:adherence_constraint} and~\ref{sec:stayontrack_constraint}---influences the driving style. This analysis compares the nominal trajectory, obtained without robustified constraints, with those resulting from a robustified stay-on-track constraint (denoted as SoT), a robustified adherence limit constraint (denoted as Adh), and a scenario where both constraints are robustified (denoted as SoT+Adh). All the optimization are obtained with the open-loop method described in Section~\ref{sec:open_loop_planning}, setting $H=4$, and $\ga^\textrm{SoT}=\ga^\textrm{Adh}=1.28$, corresponding to a 90\% probability of meeting both constraints. 

Figure~\ref{fig:ol_telemetries} presents the variation of four signals with respect to the nominal trajectory, for the three previously mentioned cases. The panels display the longitudinal speed $u$ (first panel), wheel steering angle $\delta$ (second panel), total longitudinal force $F_x$ (third panel), and lateral deviation of the center of mass from the track centerline $e$ (fourth panel). Except for the $u$ panel, each plot includes dashed black lines that indicate the sign of the nominal signal-whether it is positive, negative, or numerically zero. These sign indicators are represented as three distinct levels---high, zero, and low---corresponding to positive, zero, and negative values of the nominal signal, respectively. The levels are scaled appropriately in each plot to ensure clarity of visualization.

From the first panel, it can be observed that all configurations maintain a lower mean value of the longitudinal speed compared to the nominal trajectory, resulting in an increased sector time. The two configurations incorporating the robustified stay-on-track constraint exhibit, as expected, a significantly altered CoM trajectory. This behavior explains the higher longitudinal speed observed around $\alpha = 0.71$, which is followed by a sharp reduction.

The second and fourth panels clearly show that the configurations with the robustified stay-on-track constraint tend to follow a path closer to the centerline. In particular, for most of the sector, the variation in lateral displacement and the lateral displacement $e$ itself exhibit opposite signs, indicating a corrective behavior of the steering angle $\de$ that pulls the vehicle toward the centerline.
