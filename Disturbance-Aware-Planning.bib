  abstract = {This paper presents an automatic procedure to enhance the accuracy of the numerical solution of an optimal control problem (OCP) discretized via direct collocation at Gauss--Legendre points. First, a numerical solution is obtained by solving a nonlinear program (NLP). Then, the method evaluates its accuracy and adaptively changes both the degree of the approximating polynomial within each mesh interval and the number of mesh intervals until a prescribed accuracy is met. The number of mesh intervals is increased for all state vector components alike, in a classical fashion. Instead, improving on state-of-the-art procedures, the degrees of the polynomials approximating the different components of the state vector are allowed to assume, in each finite element, distinct values. This explains the pnh definition, where n is the state dimension. With respect to the approaches found in the literature, where the degree is always raised to the highest order for all the state components, our methods allow a sensible reduction of the overall number of variables of the resulting NLP, with a corresponding reduction of the computational burden. Numerical tests on three OCP problems highlight that, under the same maximum allowable error, by independently selecting the degree of the polynomial for each state, our method effectively picks lower degrees for some of the states, thus reducing the overall number of variables in the NLP. Accordingly, various advantages are brought about, the most remarkable being: (i) an increased computational efficiency for the final enhanced mesh with solution accuracy still within the prescribed tolerance, (ii) a reduced risk of being trapped by local minima due to the reduced NLP size, and (iii) a gain of the robustness of the convergence process due to the better-behaved solution landscapes.

  abstract = {This paper derives the dynamic equations of a reduced-order race-car model using Lie-group methods. While these methods are familiar to computational dynamicists and roboticists, their adoption in the vehicle dynamics community is limited. We address this gap by demonstrating how this framework integrates smoothly with the Articulated-Body Algorithm (ABA) and provides a fresh and systematic formulation of vehicle dynamics. For the first time, we model the car body as the end effector of a serial robot with a floating base connected to the track via virtual revolute and prismatic joints. Our formulation also accounts for the effects of 3D track geometry, providing a natural embedding of the car into the 3D track. We rigorously reconcile the ABA steps with key aspects of vehicle dynamics, including road-tire interactions, aerodynamic forces, and load transfers. The resulting model, simple yet accurate, is a powerful tool to efficiently solve Minimum-Lap-Time Planning problems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show numerical results obtained on the N{\"u}rburgring circuit. Our optimization problem is formulated via a direct collocation method and solved using the CasADi optimization suite. To validate the results, we test our reduced-order model against a full-fledged multi-body model recently developed by the same authors. The comparison confirms the validity of our reduced-order model, proving both the accuracy of the solution and the computational efficiency achieved. {\copyright} 2023, The Author(s).},

While there exist numerical techniques for flight dynamics analysis, these tend to be limited in their predictive capabilities given their dependence to either linearized system dynamics or their conservativeness. This paper proposes a new method contributing to the roadmap toward flight certification that expands the safe flight envelope by incorporating multiple Shape Functions within the sum-of-squares optimization framework. The technique, formulated using polynomial Lyapunov functions, ensures controller stability and performance. The proposed approach achieves a larger region of attraction estimation. The method is validated via the estimation of a region of attraction for closed-loop polynomial dynamics of the Vought F-8 Crusader aircraft. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through extensive simulations, illustrating its applicability in flight control system analysis and providing an expanded safe, and stable operating region. The enhanced region of attraction offers improved operational flexibility, as well as safety margins and system performance.},

  abstract = {Autonomous vehicles need to plan trajectories to a specified goal that avoid obstacles. For robust execution, we must take into account uncertainty, which arises due to uncertain localization, modeling errors, and disturbances. Prior work handled the case of set-bounded uncertainty. We present here a chanceconstrained approach, which uses instead a probabilistic representation of uncertainty. The new approach plans the future probabilistic distribution of the vehicle state so that the probability of failure is below a specified threshold. Failure occurs when the vehicle collides with an obstacle or leaves an operator-specified region. The key idea behind the approach is to use bounds on the probability of collision to show that, for linear-Gaussian systems, we can approximate the nonconvex chance-constrained optimization problem as a disjunctive convex program. This can be solved to global optimality using branch-and-bound techniques. In order to improve computation time, we introduce a customized solution method that returns almost-optimal solutions along with a hard bound on the level of suboptimality. We present an empirical validation with an aircraft obstacle avoidance example.},

The vibration data of the laboratory slewing bearing test-rig run at 1 rpm was acquired daily from February to August 2007 (138 days). As time progressed, a more accurate observation of the alteration of bearing condition from normal to faulty was obtained using nonlinear features extraction. These findings suggest that these methods provide superior descriptive information about bearing condition than time-domain features extraction, such as root mean square (RMS), variance, skewness and kurtosis.},

Particularly in rotorcraft dynamics, problems often exhibit time-periodic behavior, and modern designs consider nonlinearities to achieve a more accurate representation of the system dynamics. Nonlinearities in rotorcraft may arise from factors such as nonlinear damper constitutive laws or the influence of fluid-structure interaction, among others. Regardless of their origin, quantifying the stability of nonlinear systems typically relies on calculating their Jacobian matrix. However, accessing the Jacobian matrix of a system is often challenging or impractical, calling for the use of data-driven methods. This introduces additional complexity in capturing the characteristic dynamics of the system.

  abstract = {We consider the problem of steering a linear dynamical system with complete state observation from an initial Gaussian distribution in state-space to a final one with minimum energy control. The system is stochastically driven through the control channels; an example for such a system is that of an inertial particle experiencing random ``white noise'' forcing. We show that a target probability distribution can always be achieved in finite time. The optimal control is given in state-feedback form and is computed explicitly by solving a pair of differential Lyapunov equations that are nonlinearly coupled through their boundary values. This result, given its attractive algorithmic nature, appears to have several potential applications such as to quality control, control of industrial processes, as well as to active control of nanomechanical systems and molecular cooling. The problem to steer a diffusion process between end-point marginals has a long history (Schr{\"o}dinger bridges) and the present case of steering a linear stochastic system constitutes such a Schr{\"o}dinger bridge for possibly degenerate diffusions. Our results provide the first implementable form of the optimal control for a general Gauss--Markov process. Illustrative examples are provided for steering inertial particles and for ``cooling'' a stochastic oscillator. A final result establishes directly the property of Schr{\"o}dinger bridges as the most likely random evolution between given marginals to the present context of linear stochastic systems. A second part to this work, that is to appear as part II, addresses the general situation where the stochastic excitation enters through channels that may differ from those used to control.},

  abstract = {We address the problem of steering the state of a linear stochastic system to a prescribed distribution over a finite horizon with minimum energy, and the problem to maintain the state at a stationary distribution over an infinite horizon with minimum power. For both problems the control and Gaussian noise channels are allowed to be distinct, thereby, placing the results of this paper outside of the scope of previous work both in probability and in control. The special case where the disturbance and control enter through the same channels has been addressed in the first part of this work that was presented as Part I. Herein, we present sufficient conditions for optimality in terms of a system of dynamically coupled Riccati equations in the finite horizon case and in terms of algebraic conditions for the stationary case. We then address the question of feasibility for both problems. For the finite-horizon case, provided the system is controllable, we prove that without any restriction on the directionality of the stochastic disturbance it is always possible to steer the state to any arbitrary Gaussian distribution over any specified finite time-interval. For the stationary infinite horizon case, it is not always possible to maintain the state at an arbitrary Gaussian distribution through constant state-feedback. It is shown that covariances of admissible stationary Gaussian distributions are characterized by a certain Lyapunov-like equation and, in fact, they coincide with the class of stationary state covariances that can be attained by a suitable stationary colored noise as input. We finally address the question of how to compute suitable controls numerically. We present an alternative to solving the system of coupled Riccati equations, by expressing the optimal controls in the form of solutions to (convex) semi-definite programs for both cases. We conclude with an example to steer the state covariance of the distribution of inertial particles to an admissible stationary Gaussian distribution over a finite interval, to be maintained at that stationary distribution thereafter by constant-gain state-feedback control.},

Renewed interest in this problem was sparked by a reformulation in the language of stochastic control. In earlier works, presented as Part I and Part II, we explored a generalization of the original SBP that amounts to optimal steering of linear stochastic dynamical systems between state-distributions, at two points in time, under full state feedback. In these works, the cost was quadratic in the control input, i.e., control energy. The purpose of the present work is to detail the technical steps in extending the framework to the case where a quadratic cost in the state is also present. Thus, the main contribution is to derive the optimal control in this case which in fact is given in closed-form (Theorem 1). In the zero-noise limit, we also obtain the solution of a (deterministic) mass transport problem with general quadratic cost.},

To effectively handle the resulting complexity, we devised an efficient direct dynamics computational method based on Featherstone's articulated-body algorithm (ABA). To solve the MLTP, we employed a direct-collocation technique, discretizing the problem so that all information of the 3D track is pre-processed and directly embedded into the discrete problem. This discretization approach turns out to be perfectly compatible with our vehicle model, leading to a solution in accessible computational time frames. The high level of detail of the model makes the proposed approach most useful for in-depth vehicle dynamics analyses on complex tracks. To substantiate the analysis, we provide a comparison with the results obtained by a double-track model on the N{\"u}rburgring Nordschleife circuit. Consistently with the average trend defined by the double track, the proposed model features a more dynamically rich behavior, realistically capturing the higher-order effects elicited by the sharp corners and the highly variable slope of the track. {\copyright} 2023 by the authors.},

The outer loop consists in a genetic algorithm that optimizes the co-design variables according to the system average performance when tracking a locally optimal trajectory in perturbed simulations. The tracking controller exploits the locally optimal feedback gains computed in the inner loop with a Differential Dynamic Programming algorithm, which finds the optimal reference trajectories. Our simulations feature a complete actuation model, including friction compensation and bandwidth limits. This strategy can potentially account for arbitrary perturbations, and discards solutions that cannot robustly meet the task requirements. The results show improved performance of the designed platform in realistic application scenarios, autonomously leading to the selection of lightweight and more transparent hardware.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Investigating the stability of stationary motions is a highly relevant aspect when characterizing dynamical systems. For equilibria and periodic motions, well established theories and approaches exist to assess their stability: in both cases stability may be assessed using eigenvalue analyses of small perturbations. When it comes to quasi-periodic motions, such eigenvalue analyses are not applicable, since these motions can not be parameterized on finite time intervals. However, quasi-periodic motions can be densely embedded on finite invariant manifolds with periodic boundaries. In this contribution, a new approach is presented, which exploits this embedding in order to derive a sequence of finite mappings. Based on these mappings, the spectrum of 1st order               Lyapunov               -exponents is efficiently calculated. If the linearization of the problem is regular in the sense of               Lyapunov               , these exponents may be used to assess stability of the investigated solution. Beyond the numerical calculation of               Lyapunov               -exponents, an approach is presented which allows to check               Lyapunov               -regularity numerically. Together, both methods allow for an efficient numerical stability assessment of quasi-periodic motions. To demonstrate, verify and validate the developed approach, it is applied to quasi-periodic motions of two coupled               van-der-Pol               oscillators as well as a quasi-periodically forced               Duffing               equation.

The aim is to evaluate quantitatively how set-up parameters, like distribution of aerodynamic loads, weight and roll stiffness between front and rear axles, affect the driving style, encoded in the shape of the optimal trajectory and in the acceleration, brake and steer inputs. To this aim, we develop an optimization code that includes a double-track vehicle model capable of solving the minimum lap-time problem (MLTP) on a given track. The track is represented via NURBS curves and the MLTP is framed and solved as an optimal control problem by transcription into a nonlinear program using direct collocation. To assess the accuracy of the vehicle model and the optimization pipeline, we also validate our results against real telemetry data. The developed software framework lends itself to easily perform both sensitivity analysis and concurrent trajectory planning and set-up parameter optimization: this is obtained by simple promotion of static parameters of interests to variables in the optimal control problem.

To maximize computational efficiency, we exploit sparsity patterns in the linear algebra expressions generated during the solution of the optimization problem and leverage Algorithmic Differentiation to calculate derivatives.

The presented approach considers the robot motion to be subject to process noise bounded by ellipsoidal sets. In order to efficiently handle the evolution of the disturbance ellipsoids within the MPC, the zero-order robust optimization (zoRO) scheme is applied [1]. The idea is to fix the disturbance ellipsoids within one optimization iteration and solve the problem repeatedly with updated disturbance ellipsoid trajectories. The zero-order approach is suboptimal in general. However, we show that it does not impair convergence to the reference trajectory in the absence of obstacles. The experiments on an industrial mobile robot prototype demonstrate the performance of the controller.},

The approach is based on the introduction of the novel concept of closedloop sensitivity, a quantity that relates parameter variations to deviations of the closed-loop trajectory of the system/controller pair. This new definition takes into account the dependency of the control inputs from the system states and nominal parameters as well as from the controller dynamics. The reference trajectory to be tracked is taken as optimization variable, and the dynamics of both the sensitivity and of its gradient are computed analytically along the system trajectories. We then show how this computation can be effectively exploited for solving trajectory optimization problems aimed at generating a reference trajectory that minimizes a norm of the closed-loop sensitivity. The theoretical results are validated via an extensive campaign of Monte Carlo simulations for two relevant robotic systems: a unicycle and a quadrotor UAV.},

Afterwards, a novel method of Direct Boolean Generation is proposed to deal with the generation of variable-ratio rack and pinion drives in more involved three-dimensional scenarios. This approach has proved to be more robust and efficient than the analytical method with this type of gears. Two geometric layouts are investigated: (i) parallel-axis rack and pinion provided with arbitrarily shaped tooth curves in the lengthwise (axial) direction, (ii) skew-axis rack and pinion provided with helical teeth. An optimization procedure is also proposed to maximize the variability of the transmission ratio function while avoiding undercut and tooth pointing. A numerical test case and its 3D-printed counterpart are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Boolean generation method and optimization procedure.},

In contrast with existing methods with a shape function centered at the equilibrium point, the proposed method utilizes a shifted shape function (SSF) with its center shifted iteratively towards the boundary of the newly obtained invariant subset to improve ROA estimation. A set of shifting centers with corresponding SSFs is generated to produce proven subsets of the exact ROA and then a composition method, namely R-composition, is employed to express these independent sets in a compact form by just a single but richer-shaped level set. The proposed method denoted as RcomSSF brings a significant improvement for general ROA estimation problems, especially for nonsymmetric or unbounded ROA, while keeping the computational burden at a reasonable level. Its effectiveness and advantages are demonstrated by several benchmark examples from literature.},

Lyapunov exponents represent a means to measure the rate of convergence or divergence of nearby trajectories thus denoting chaos and possibly leading to the onset of conditions that produce capsize. The work developed here makes use of Lyapunov exponent methodologies to study capsize and chaotic behavior in vessels both experimentally and numerically using a multi-degree of freedom computational model. Since, the Lyapunov exponent is defined in the limit as time approaches infinity, one encounters fundamental difficulties using Lyapunov exponents on the capsize problem, which is inherently limited to a finite time. This work also incorporates the use of local Lyapunov exponents, which do not require an infinite time series, to demonstrate their usefulness in analyzing finite time chaotic vessel phenomena. The objective is to demonstrate the value of the Lyapunov exponent and local Lyapunov exponent as a predictive tool with which to indicate regions with crucial sensitivity to initial conditions. Through the intelligent use of Lyapunov exponents in vessel analysis to indicate specific regions of questionable stability, one may significantly reduce the volume of costly simulation and experimentation.},

  abstract = {We present a method for the approximate propagation of mean and covariance of a probability distribution through ordinary differential equations (ODE) with discontinuous right-hand side. For piecewise affine systems, a normalization of the propagated probability distribution at every time step allows us to analytically compute the expectation integrals of the mean and covariance dynamics while explicitly taking into account the discontinuity. This leads to a natural smoothing of the discontinuity such that for relevant levels of uncertainty the resulting ODE can be integrated directly with standard schemes and it is neither necessary to prespecify the switching sequence nor to use a switch detection method. We then show how this result can be employed in the more general case of piecewise smooth functions based on a structure preserving linearization scheme. The resulting dynamics can be straightforwardly used within standard formulations of stochastic optimal control problems with chance constraints.},

Crucially, the algorithm does not only optimize the nominal control trajectory, but the decision variables include linear feedback gains for each time step. In consequence, the resulting trajectories do not suffer from the unrealistically large uncertainty sets of openloop robust trajectories, but are able to approximately capture the feedback behavior implicit to model predictive control. The proposed algorithm iterates by alternatingly performing a Riccati recursion and solving a perturbed nominal optimal control problem. We provide a theoretical analysis of the local convergence behavior and demonstrate its basic applicability on the example problem of controlling a towing kite.},

To the best of our knowledge, covariance steering problems with probabilistic chance constraints have not been discussed previously in the literature, although their treatment seems to be a natural extension. In this letter, we first show that, unlike the case with no chance constraints, the covariance steering problem with chance constraints cannot be decoupled to mean and covariance steering sub-problems. We then propose an approach to solve the covariance steering problem with chance constraints by converting it to a convex programming problem. The proposed algorithm is verified using a numerical example.},

While several path planning algorithms have been proposed over the years, many of them have dealt with only deterministic environments or with only open-loop uncertainty, i.e., the uncertainty of the system state is not controlled and, typically, increases with time because of exogenous disturbances. This may lead to potentially conservative nominal paths. The typical approach to deal with disturbances and reduce uncertainty is to use a lower level feedback controller. We advocate the premise that, if a path planner can consider the closed-loop evolution of the system uncertainty, it can lead to less conservative, but still feasible, paths. To this end, in this letter, we develop an approach that is based on optimal covariance steering, which explicitly steers the state covariance for stochastic linear systems. We verify the proposed framework using extensive numerical simulations.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an automated algorithm to analyze the stability of piecewise affine (PWA) dynamical systems due to their broad applications. We parametrize the Lyapunov function as a PWA function, with polytopic regions defined by the PWA dynamics. Using this parametrization, Stability conditions can be expressed as linear constraints restricted to polytopes so that the search for a Lyapunov function involves solving a linear program. However, a valid Lyapunov function might not be found given these polytopic regions. A natural response is to increase the size of the parametrization of the Lyapunov function by dividing regions and solving the new linear program. This paper proposes two new methods to divide each polytope into smaller ones. The first approach divides a polytope based on the sign of the derivative of the candidate Lyapunov function, while the second divides it based on the change in the vector field of the PWA dynamical system. In addition, we propose using Delaunay triangulation to achieve automated division of regions and preserve the continuity of the PWA Lyapunov function. Examples involving learned models and explicit MPC controllers demonstrate that the proposed method of dividing regions leads to valid Lyapunov functions with fewer regions than existing methods, reducing the computational time taken for stability analysis},

This method, described as Sequential Estimation of RoA based on Invariant Set Estimation (SEROAISE), computes a Lyapunov-like PWA function over a certified PWA invariant set. While traditional approaches search for Lyapunov functions by enforcing Lyapunov conditions over pre-selected domains, this framework enforces Lyapunov-like conditions over a certified invariant subset obtained using the Iterative Invariant Set Estimator(IISE). Compared to the state-of-the-art, IISE provides systematically larger certified invariant sets. In order to find a larger invariant subset, the IISE utilizes a novel concept known as the Non-Uniform Growth of Invariant Set (NUGIS). A number of examples illustrating the efficacy of the proposed methods are provided, including dynamical systems derived from learning algorithms.

Region-of-attraction approximation problems are considered for polynomial, polynomial with generalized Lur'e uncertainty, and rational trigonometric multi-rigid-body systems. Our method starts by identifying that Lagrange multipliers, traditionally heavily used for S-procedures, are a major culprit of creating bloated SOS programs. In light of this, we exploit inherent system properties such as continuity, convexity, and implicit algebraic structure, and reformulate the problems as quotient-ring SOS programs, thereby eliminating all the multipliers. These new programs are smaller, sparser, less constrained, yet less conservative. Their computation is further improved by leveraging a recent result on sampling algebraic varieties. Remarkably, solution correctness is guaranteed with just a finite (in practice, very small) number of samples. Altogether, the proposed method can verify systems well beyond the reach of existing SOS-based approaches (29 states); on smaller problems where a baseline is available, it computes tighter solution 2-3 orders faster.

  abstract = {The problem of computing bounds on the region-of-attraction for systems with polynomial vector fields is considered. Invariant subsets of the region-of-attraction are characterized as sublevel sets of Lyapunov functions. Finite-dimensional polynomial parametrizations for Lyapunov functions are used. A methodology utilizing information from simulations to generate Lyapunov function candidates satisfying necessary conditions for bilinear constraints is proposed. The suitability of Lyapunov function candidates is assessed solving linear sum-of-squares optimization problems. Qualified candidates are used to compute invariant subsets of the region-of-attraction and to initialize various bilinear search strategies for further optimization. We illustrate the method on small examples from the literature and several control oriented systems.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose an efficient zero-order algorithm that can be used to compute an approximate solution to robust optimal control problems (OCP) and robustified nonconvex programs in general. In particular, we focus on robustified OCPs that make use of ellipsoidal uncertainty sets and show that, with the proposed zero-order method, we can efficiently obtain suboptimal, but robustly feasible solutions. The main idea lies in leveraging an inexact sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm in which an advantageous sparsity structure is enforced. The obtained sparsity allows one to eliminate the variables associated with the propagation of the ellipsoidal uncertainty sets and to solve a reduced problem with the same dimensionality and sparsity structure of a nominal OCP. The inexact algorithm can drastically reduce the computational complexity of the SQP iterations (e.g., in the case where a structure exploiting interior-point method is used to solve the underlying quadratic programs (QPs), from O(N {$\cdot$} (n6x + n3u)) to O(N {$\cdot$} (n3x + n3u))). Moreover, standard embedded QP solvers for nominal problems can be leveraged to solve the reduced QP.},

The approach iteratively solves the robustified problem by incorporating updated state-dependent safety margins for collision avoidance, the evolution of which is derived separately from the robustified problem. Additionally, a strategy for selecting an alternative terminal state to reach is introduced, which comes into play when the desired terminal state becomes infeasible considering the disturbances. Both of these contributions are integrated into a robustified motion planning and control pipeline, the efficacy of which is validated through simulation experiments.},

The approach defines a robustified two-stage Optimal Control Problem (OCP), in which stage 1, with a fixed time grid, is seamlessly stitched with stage 2, which features a variable time grid. Stage 1 optimizes not only the nominal trajectory, but also feedback gains and corresponding state covariances, which robustify constraints in both stages. The outcome is a minimized uncertainty in stage 1 and a minimized total motion time for stage 2, both contributing to the time optimality and safety of the total motion. A timely replanning strategy is employed to handle changes in constraints and maintain feasibility, while a tailored iterative algorithm is proposed for efficient, real-time OCP execution.},

Additionally, it has been proved that thanks to the Covector Mapping Principle (CMP)~there is essentially no distinction between direct and indirect methods when Pseudo Spectral collocation is used. In this work, inspired by CMP, a map is proposed to connect the discretized equations~of the indirect method with those resulting from the direct transcription with the same trapezoidal scheme. The indirect method will benefit this new formulation since it can adopt the same regularization techniques typically implemented in direct approaches while still maintaining the explicit solution of the control as a function of the states and co-states in a bi-level optimization solution strategy. Finally, the proposed mapping is also derived for the implicit dynamics.},

However, most of the published works deal with two-dimensional roads and employ the so-called apex-finding method. This paper focuses on the application to three-dimensional roads, both with an extension of the `apex-finding' approach to three-dimensional scenarios and with an optimal control method. Both approaches are based on g--g--g diagrams, i.e. the three-dimensional extension of the well-known g--g maps. In addition, under the assumption that the predefined trajectory is determined from noisy data (e.g. logged from the real vehicle), the three-dimensional trajectory reconstruction problem is addressed, to find a smooth and drift-free racing line to be used in the minimum-time simulation -- again an optimal control approach is employed for the trajectory reconstruction. Examples of application are given both for a car and a motorcycle.},

This work describes the extension of the method to three-dimensional tracks and builds upon g--g--g diagrams (instead of the standard g--g), to account for the effects of three-dimensionality. The main features of car and motorcycle g--g--g diagrams are discussed, to get insight into the main effects of three-dimensionality and to suggest a convenient parametrisation for the subsequent optimal control problem (OCP), whose size is not affected by the complexity of the vehicle model employed to generate the g--g--g diagrams. The application of the method to the Mugello and Barcelona--Catalunya circuits is given, with vehicle datasets resembling those of a race motorcycle (MotoGP) and a race car (Formula One). The results obtained are in line with those reported in the literature using full-dynamic models, yet such dynamic models are generally associated with the solution of much larger OCP.},

The different points of the g-g diagram are usually computed independently from one another, e.g. the maximum longitudinal accelerations corresponding to given lateral accelerations are computed sequentially. In this work, the problem of computing the points of the g-g diagram is transformed into an optimal control problem, which allows to avoid one of the most annoying practical problems often encountered when deriving such diagrams, namely the `jumps' between different solutions (i.e. large slip vs. small slip solutions at similar lateral acceleration) in adjacent points along the g-g envelope. In the proposed method, the objective is to maximise the area enclosed within the g-g diagram, which has a polar representation. The rate of change of the radial coordinate is the control input. Additional constraints are included to enforce the continuity between the states of the vehicle model in adjacent points along the envelope. These conditions can hardly be enforced using standard methods based on sequential and independent computation of the g-g points. An example of the application of the method is demonstrated on the classic double-track car model with nonlinear tyres.},
